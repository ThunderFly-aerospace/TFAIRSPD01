# Venturi effect based airspeed sensor 

The airspeed sensor ideal for low airspeed measuremens. It is based on venturi anemometer which is developed for stationary weather stations in harsh environment. 
The sensor itself consist IMU sensor, therefore the sensor could be also used as angle-of-attact sensor. For AoA sensor the tube must by mounted on movable axis.
